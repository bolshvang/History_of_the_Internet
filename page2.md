## People that Shaped the Internet

* **J.C.R. Licklider** (*1960*) - a psychologist from MIT who originally envisioned the seminal idea of the internet
* **Paul Baran** (*1964*) - hired by the U.S. Government during the cold war to see if an indestructible communications network could be built
  * Borrowing an idea from the telegraph, Baran decided to chop up messages into equal size pieces called
    "Packets"
* **Bob Taylor** (*1969*) - an ARPA scientist that wanted to create a computer network that would allow one terminal to communicate with multiple machines on the same network rather than one terminal for each machine (and transfer files)

* **Larry Roberts** *(1967*) - built the world's first experimental connection between two computers at MIT
    * began working on the ARPA Net
* **Bolt Beranek and Newman** (*1968*) - won the governement contract to build IMPs for ARPA Net
* **Bob Metcalfe** (*1970*)- a grad student at MIT that connected MITs computer to the ARPA Net network
    * co-invented ethernet and created Metcalfe's Theory which describes the effect of a communications network
* **Raymond Tomlinson** (*1978*) - invented EMAIL. He was working on a mail program but only worked within a single computer, when he soon realized the mail was a file. He put the mail and file program together and the the mail files could be sent across to different computers
* **Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn** (*1973*) - Vint Cerf and Bob Kah teamed up to develop a set of rules and procedures known as the TCP/IP protocol. That if followed by different computer networks, would allow them to send their message packets back and forth
    * Together they created Internet Working Protocol which turned into the Internet
* **Tim Burners Lee** (*1989*)- a physicist at CERN Research Institute in Switzerland created an easier way to use the internet (*World Wide Web*)
* **Marc Andreessen** (*1993*) - create a user friendly software to browse the World Wide Web called Netscape

* **1969** - All four computers were able to connect and send files through the ARPA Net
* **1971** - the ARPA Net had 18 mainframe computers hooked into the network
* **1972** - ARPA Net had fewer than 25 sites online, but more were coming
* **1983** - TCP/IP was adopted as the universal standard (a common network of interconnected networks)
* **1992** - On June 9, 1992, congress passed a bill that allowed the public to use the internet
    * only 50 web pages were on the internet
* **1994** - after the web browser hit, the web grew by 341,000%
