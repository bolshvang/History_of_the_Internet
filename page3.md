# **Wires, Cables, Wifi, Bits, and Binary Code**
## What are they for and how do they work?

- The internet is a tangible physical system made to move information, and it does this through the use of **binary code**
    - Machines must translate 1s and 0s to radio waves of different frequencies or through cables/wires  and the receiving machines must revert back to binary on the computer
    
    - Fiber optic cables were needed because light travels through these fiber optic cables and pulses to represent information in binary code.  The cables are able to send 10 billion pulses of information every second!

- Wifi utilizes radio signals and then transfers the information to a receiver which is attached to a wire
    - Your laptop is connected through WIFI, then that WIFI is connected to an internet service provider (ISP)
    - Your ISP connects you to billions of devices around the world through hundreds of thousands of networks that are interconnected

## Metrics and Terms 
- Information is made of Bits (any pair of opposites)
    - Typically use a 1 (on) or a 0 (off) - as discussed in **binary code**
- 8 bits strung together = 1 Byte
- 1000 Bytes = 1 Kilobyte
- 1000 Kilobytes = 1 Mega Byte

- Bitrate - the number of bits per second a system can transmit
- Bandwidth - maximum transmission capacity of a device measured by *bitrate*
- Latency - time it takes for a bit to travel from sender to receiver
- Ethernet Wire - measurable signal loss over a few hundred feet
