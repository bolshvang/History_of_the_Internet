My name is Brandon Olshvang, and I am current Graduate Student at NJIT in the Information Systems program.

I created this website to help students and inquistive people have a website they can go to, in order to gain valuable information about the internet and its origins

There are so many different factors and elements that contributed to the internet and how it began, and I want to share that knowledge with all of you.
