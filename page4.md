## What is an IP Address?
- IP stands for *Internet Protocol*, so a computers address is called its IP Address
- All different devices on the internet have unique addresses; an address on the internet is a number that is unique to the device
- IP Addresses are represented in bits .  A traditional IP Address is 32 bits (*as pictured above*).
- An IP Address is broken into 4 parts and organized in a hierarchy
    - First is the country/network, next is the region/network, followed by the subnetwork, and last is the device
- This version of IP Addressing is called IPv4, designed in 1973
    - IPv6 is the newest version of IP Addressing and has 128 bits per address and provides 340 Undecillion unique addresses

## What is a Domain Name System (DNS)?
- DNS associates names like www.example.com with the associated addresses
- Your computer uses the DNS to look up the main names and get the associated IP address which is used to connect your computer to the destination on the internet
- DNS Servers are connected in a distributed hierarchy
    - The servers split up responsibility for the major domains such as (.net, .com, .org, etc.)
- DNS was created to be an Open Public Communication Protocol for government and education institutions
- Because it is open, it is susceptible to cyber-attacks, such as DNS Server and changes it to match a domain
    - DNS Spoofing - when a hacker hacks into a DNS Server and changes it to match a domain name with the wrong IP address and sends users to an imposter website
- DNS and Internet Protocol are designed to scale no matter how much internet grows
